The objective of the project is to create a guessing number game, generating random numbers from 1 to 10.

Task: 
1)	Generate a random number from 1 to 10
2)	Ask the user to guess the number

Process:

2)	A number is randomly chosen by the program
3)	User is asked to guess the number
4)	User is given 3 chances to guess the number
